# Week 4 - C programming - arrays and strings, static and dynamic arrays

## Compiling C source code

Remember that you compile source code using `gcc` and should name the output file

`gcc myCode.c -o myCode`

## C libraries

Most of your code this week will require `<stdio.h>` and `<stdlib.h>` 

We will also introduce the string library `<string.h>`

If you are writing your own code remember to `#include` libraries.

## Executing C programs

The executable file is stored on your local disk.

To execute the program you use the executable file name

`./myCode`

Note: `./` tells the operating system to look in the current, local directory for the executable file.

Remember to recompile the code after making changes so that the executable file is updated.
